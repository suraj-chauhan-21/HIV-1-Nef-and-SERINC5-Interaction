# HIV-1-Nef-and-SERINC5-Interaction
This project investigates the interaction between HIV-1 Nef and SERINC5. The aim is to simulate data, test hypotheses, and present findings. Key elements include data simulation, code, graphs, a proposed hypothesis, and results.

**Objective:**
To investigate the impact of altered CD3G expression in T lymphocytes on immune function and its
potential implications in the context of viral infections, specifically HIV-1

**Hypothesis:**
Higher CD3G expression in T lymphocytes leads to enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and
augmented T cell activation (Enhanced TCR Signaling Hypothesis / Augmented T Cell Activation Hypothesis).
This heightened activation state may indirectly influence the host-virus interaction, particularly concerning the
antiviral restriction factor SERINC5 and its counteraction by viral proteins like HIV-1 Nef.


**Rationale:**
CD3G is a crucial component of the TCR-CD3 complex, essential for initiating T cell activation
upon antigen recognition. Higher expression of CD3G is likely to result in more efficient and robust TCR
signaling. SERINC5 is a host protein that inhibits HIV-1 infectivity, and its function is antagonized by the viral
Nef protein. While there is no direct evidence of CD3G regulating SERINC5, the overall activation state of T
cells, potentially influenced by CD3G levels, could affect the cellular environment and the dynamics of host-
virus interactions, including the effectiveness of Nef's counteraction of SERINC5. Understanding this interplay
may provide insights into immune responses during viral infections.
